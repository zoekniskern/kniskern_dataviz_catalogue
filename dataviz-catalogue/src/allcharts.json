These graphs can offer insights and visually assist users in detecting patterns and relationships. When used with a large network of information, this visualization can be used to tell a story. The interactivity of force directed graphs is also an additional positive quality.",

The outside circle is labelled with groupings, called nodes, that are then in turn connected by arcs, or arc connections.

Color is often used to show the directionality of the data.",
